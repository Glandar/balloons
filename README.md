# Balloons
Requirements
------------
The game requires to be installed in a single folder and depends on: os, pygame, math, time, random, numpy, scipy, itertools & collections. This includes the "game_data" folder, the name of the profile inside this folder can be changed to your own name if you also change the string in the profile.txt file.

The console or command window is used to print information and ask for confirmation on irreversible actions, other than that the game takes place in a 750 by 800 window.

Gameplay
--------
Balloons is a platformer/puzzle game.
In this game you control 2 balloons which have to deliver air to several target locations. Every time this is done the balloons lose air and therefore size, this means that they can fit through smaller gaps but also can not jump as high. This means that the order of operations is very important to the difficulty and possibleness of the platformer part of this game.

The game comes with 36 levels (and a level creator), the first 9 of which are introductionary, the other levels are of varying difficulty and in no specific order.

Bugs
----
There is a bug that occurs when approaching a platform at a certain angle which causes inaccurate physics but does not interfere with the gameplay. Other than that I am not aware of any bugs, however the testing has not been rigorous.
